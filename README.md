## PyBank:
The basis for the code used in the "#Show On Screen Output" and "#Output data to text file" sections was worked on in a study session with Steve Bennet so if there are any similarities in our code here this is why

for the section "#Adding the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period" i had been assisted in the right direction by AskBCS

for finishing up the "#Calculating the change of monthly profits and losses" "#finding average change", and the "#Calculating the greatest changes of the monthly profits and losses" sections i had assistance being pointed in the right direction by AskBCS as my code at the time was working but giving incorrect values



## PyPoll:
The basis for the code "total_votes = sum(1 for row in name)" used as a rowcounter in the "#Initializing values of variables" section was taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16108526/how-to-obtain-the-total-numbers-of-rows-from-a-csv-file-in-python as i thought it was a cleaner simpler set of code then what was in the "05-Ins_BasicRead" activity

The basis for the code used in the "#Show On Screen Output" and "#Output data to text file" sections was from the same source as in PyBank
