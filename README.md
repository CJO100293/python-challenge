# python-challenge
## **Background:**

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and enter the world of programming with Python. In this assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

### **Pybank:**

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### **PyPoll:**

In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

# **Sources:**
## **PyBank Section:**

The basis for the code used in the "#Show On Screen Output" and "#Output data to text file" sections was worked on in a study session with Steve Bennet so if there are any similarities in our code here this is why

For the section "#Adding the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period" i had been assisted in the right direction by AskBCS

For finishing up the "#Calculating the change of monthly profits and losses" "#finding average change", and the "#Calculating the greatest changes of the monthly profits and losses" sections i had assistance being pointed in the right direction by AskBCS as my code at the time was working but giving incorrect values

## **PyPoll Section:**

The basis for the code "total_votes = total_votes + 1" used as a rowcounter in the "#Initializing values of variables" section to get the total votes with all candidates was provided with the assistance of Steve Bennet

Steve Bennet also helped nudge me in the right direction for figuring out the "#Candidate List + calculating total votes per candidate" section

The basis for the code used in the "#Show On Screen Output" and "#Output data to text file" sections was from the same source as in PyBank

The basis for the code used to format the "votes_percent" variable as a decimal rounded to the last 3 decimal places was found at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51328193/understanding-the-print-format-3-in-python

I used https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/index for help in using the indexes function in order to calculate who the winner is based on the greatest amount of candidate votes
