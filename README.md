## PyBank:
The basis for the code used in the "#Show On Screen Output" and "#Output data to text file" sections was worked on in a study session with Steve Bennet so if there are any similarities in our code here this is why

for the section "#Adding the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period" i had been assisted in the right direction by AskBCS

for finishing up the "#Calculating the change of monthly profits and losses" "#finding average change", and the "#Calculating the greatest changes of the monthly profits and losses" sections i had assistance being pointed in the right direction by AskBCS as my code at the time was working but giving incorrect values



## PyPoll:
The basis for the code "total_votes = total_votes + 1" used as a rowcounter in the "#Initializing values of variables" section to get the total votes with all candidates was provided with the assistance of Steve Bennet

The basis for the code used in the "#Show On Screen Output" and "#Output data to text file" sections was from the same source as in PyBank
