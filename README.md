## PyBank:
The basis for the code used in the "#Show On Screen Output" and "#Output data to text file" sections was worked on in a study session with Steve Bennet so if there are any similarities in our code here this is why

For the section "#Adding the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period" i had been assisted in the right direction by AskBCS

For finishing up the "#Calculating the change of monthly profits and losses" "#finding average change", and the "#Calculating the greatest changes of the monthly profits and losses" sections i had assistance being pointed in the right direction by AskBCS as my code at the time was working but giving incorrect values



## PyPoll:
The basis for the code "total_votes = total_votes + 1" used as a rowcounter in the "#Initializing values of variables" section to get the total votes with all candidates was provided with the assistance of Steve Bennet

Steve Bennet also helped nudge me in the right direction for figuring out the "#Candidate List + calculating total votes per candidate" section

The basis for the code used in the "#Show On Screen Output" and "#Output data to text file" sections was from the same source as in PyBank

The basis for the code used to format the "votes_percent" variable as a decimal rounded to the last 3 decimal places was found at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51328193/understanding-the-print-format-3-in-python

I used https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/index for help in using the indexes function in order to calculate who the winner is based on the greatest amount of candidate votes
